## Launch Options

| **Command**  | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `-dev`  | Animations wonâ€™t be there anymore but can cause issues in performance. Disable/Remove this if you encounter problems. I personally do not recommend this setting. You should use this one at your own risk.|
| `+exec`  | Executes a cfg file on startup  |
| `-fullscreen` | The game will always launch in Fullscreen Mode. This is recommended if your windows keep re-adjusting to borderless Fullscreen or any other setting. |
| `-window / -windowed` | The game will always launch in Windowed Mode. This is up to preference.
| `+cl_showfps 4` | Shows FPS in-game. This can also be achieved with steam overlay settings, NVIDIA, or FRAPS. You can also find this setting inside the game options of Apex Legends. If you want to use this, go for it by all means.|
